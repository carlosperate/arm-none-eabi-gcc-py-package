# GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain Python Package

This project repackages the GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain from the
[Arm Developer website](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads)
into a Python package that can be easily installed via pip.

The resulting Python package includes the full toolchain and adds its binaries
to the Python environment path.

This is still a work-in-progress and doesn't work yet.

## TODO

- [x] Update wheels to have platform labels
- [x] Set up versioning
- [x] Create GH Action workflow to build and publish the wheels to GH Releases
- [x] Create GH Action workflow to test the built wheels in each OS/arch
- [x] Create a static simple repository ([PEP 503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/)) that fetches the wheels from GH Releases
- [ ] Create GH Action workflow to publish the package repository to GH Pages
- [ ] Use/fork [wheel-stub](https://github.com/wheel-next/wheel-stub/) to publish source packages to PyPI that pull these wheels externally hosted
- [ ] Keep an eye on [PEP 759 – External Wheel Hosting](https://peps.python.org/pep-0759/)

## Versioning

The package version follows `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format, but it combines the
GCC version and the `package_builder` versions, where:
- MAJOR version is the GCC major version
- MINOR version is the GCC minor version
- PATCH version is a single number indicating the version of `package_builder`
  used to create the package

So for example:

```
13 . 3 . 1
└──┬──┘ └┬┘
   │     └──── package_builder version
   └────────── GCC major.minor version
```

This allows version locking to a specific GCC version and be able to fetch the
latest `package_builder` (which might include bug fixes in the packaging),
e.g. `~=13.3`/`==13.3.*`.

## Project/repository structure

There are multiple folders in this repository to serve different facets of
this package creation and distribution:

- `arm_none_eabi_gcc_toolchain`: Contains the skeleton code for the Python
  package source code, the rest of the package data is generated by
  `package_builder`.
- `package_builder`: Contains the Python scripts used to generate the 
  complete `arm_none_eabi_gcc_toolchain` packages (which are later
  uploaded to GH releases via CI).
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`: Contains the GitHub Actions workflow used
  to build and upload the wheels into to GitHub Releases in this repository.
- `simple_repository_regenerator`: Contains the Python scripts used to
  generate the static simple repository that points to the wheels stored
  in the GH Releases.

## Building the package

A python application is provided in the `package_builder` folder to
build the package.

This application downloads an Arm GCC release, extracts it into the
`arm_none_eabi_gcc_toolchain` folder, creates additional required Python files,
and builds the `arm_none_eabi_gcc_toolchain` package.

Install the builder dependencies (it's recommended to use a virtual environment):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the builder:

```bash
python -m package_builder build
```

## Building the Simple Repository

The `simple_repository_regenerator` folder contains the Python scripts
used to generate a [PEP 503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/) compliant
static site that points to the wheels stored in the GitHub Releases from
this repository.

To generate the HTML output, run the following command:

```bash
python -m simple_repository_generator "carlosperate/arm-none-eabi-gcc-py-package"
```
