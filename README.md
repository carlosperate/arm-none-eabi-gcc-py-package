# GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain Python Package

This project repackages the GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain from the
[Arm Developer website](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads)
into a Python package that can be easily installed via pip.

The resulting Python package includes the full toolchain and adds its binaries
to the Python environment path.

This is still a work-in-progress and doesn't work yet.

## TODO

- [ ] Update wheels to have platform labels
- [ ] Create a static simple repository ([PEP 503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/)) to host the wheels via GitHub (releases+pages)
- [ ] Use or fork [wheel-stub](https://github.com/wheel-next/wheel-stub/) to be able to publish source packages to PyPI
- [ ] Keep an eye on [PEP 759 â€“ External Wheel Hosting](https://peps.python.org/pep-0759/)

## Building the package

A python application is provided in the `package_builder` folder to
build the package.

This application downloads an Arm GCC release, extracts it into the
`arm_none_eabi_gcc_toolchain` folder, creates additional required Python files,
and builds the `arm_none_eabi_gcc_toolchain` package.

Install the builder dependencies (it's recommended to use a virtual environment):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the builder:

```bash
python -m package_builder build
```
