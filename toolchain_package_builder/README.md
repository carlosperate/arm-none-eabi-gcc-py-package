# GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain Python Package Builder

This project downloads a GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain release from the
[Arm Developer website](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm)
and repackages it into a Python package that can be easily installed
via pip.
